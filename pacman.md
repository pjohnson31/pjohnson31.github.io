# Arcade Game Table

After a summer of finding every bar in NYC that had a Ms. Pacman machine, I decided it would be fun (and more economical) to build one on my own. I had an old macbook with a broken screen that served as the base for project.

The total parts consisted of a few pieces of MDF wood, a $100 LCD monitor, old PC speakers, a few arcade parts from [Ultimarc](https://www.ultimarc.com/) and four stainless steel legs. 

The macbook is running a version of windows XP (I know ðŸ˜‚) on bootcamp. The MAME OS has a bunch of classic 4-axis arcade games you can play. 

The arcade table currently sits in the engineering lounge at Kustomer's HQ in NYC.
