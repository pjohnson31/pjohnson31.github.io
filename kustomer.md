# Kustomer [ðŸ”—](https://www.kustomer.com/)

Kustomer isnâ€™t a ticketing system. Itâ€™s a customer service CRM platform for managing high support volume effortlessly. Companies like Amazon, Abercrombie, Airbnb, Unilever, and Glossier use our software to deliver efficient, yet human customer support. 

As a member of the founding Kustomer team, I've helped us grow from a company of four, no product, and zero customers to  and a product that companies on every continent (minus Antarctica) use to service hundreds of millions of customers around the world. In 2022 [Kustomer was acquired by Facebook](https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/facebook-confirms-it-has-acquired-kustomer-sources-say-for-1b/) (now Meta).

I curently serve as the head of Product, in charge of the product development and design of the Kustomer product.
