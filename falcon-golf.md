In 2019, the Professional Golf Association announced a rule change allowing players to leave the flagstick in while putting in order to speed up the pace of play. Many players quickly took advantage of this new rule only to find that pulling a golf ball out of a cup while the pin is left in is in fact far more difficult. 

My father had the idea to design, patent and manufacture a product that allows players to leave in the golf pin, but more easily remove the ball from the hole. Thus Falcon Golf was born. 

This was a fun opportunity for me to dust off my CAD, web & brand design, and shopify skills. My dad handled all of the manufacturing and initial designs. I modeled his designs in Solidworks, 3D printed our first prototypes, and set up a web store, online ads, and marketing materials for golf conferences. 

Today as covid has accelerated the need for hands-free golf product, Falcon Golf products are used in golf courses all across america and the world.
