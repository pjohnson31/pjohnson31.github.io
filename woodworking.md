# Woodworking

As a result of working in software during the week, one of my favorite weekend activities is to build physical things- usually out of wood. This album contains the follow projects I've made as gifts for friends & family (in order of appearance):
* Bookshelf - cedar & steel pipe
* TV mount - reclaimed barnwood
* Backgammon board - oak & brass (and custom-made leather dice bag)
* Bar Cart - Walnut and Brass
* Duck Calls (various woods)
* Bottle Openers & Ice Cream Scoops (Silver Maple Burl)
* Bowls (various woods, mostly walnut)
* Wedding Table Numbers (Clear Acrylic & cedar)
* Christmas Trees (various woods)
* Kustomer Hackathon Medals (Clear Acrylic)

Living in NYC it can be difficult to find space to store tools and materials. Luckily there are a few amazing resources available to make it easier:
* [Fat Cat Fab Lab](https://www.fatcatfablab.org/) is a membership-based community makerspace in the west village 
* [Makeville Studio Brooklyn](https://makeville.com/) is a community woodshop based in Gowanus, Brooklyn.
* [Dyke's Lumber](https://dykeslumber.com/) lumber yard in Gowanus, Brooklyn near Makeville.
* My Wife - for allowing me to store all of my tools, and misc raw wood and materials under our couch in our tiny one-bedroom west village apartment.
