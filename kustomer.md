Kustomer isn’t a ticketing system. It’s a customer service CRM platform for managing high support volume effortlessly. Companies like Amazon, Abercrombie, Airbnb, Unilever, and Glossier use our software to deliver efficient, yet human customer support. 

As a member of the founding Kustomer team, I've helped us grow from a company of four, no product, and zero customers to now over 180 employes and a product that companies on every continent (minus Antarctica) use to service hundreds of millions of customers around the world. 

I curently serve as the VP of Product, in charge of the product development and design of the Kustomer product.
